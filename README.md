# weather-app
My weather app using DarkSky api and skycons with moment.js.

User Story: 
- I can see the weather in my current location.
- I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
